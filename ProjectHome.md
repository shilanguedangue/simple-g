Simple G is a ready to roll-out web based **PHP calendar** application that reads information from public or private Google Calendars and displays it by day, month, or event.

Simple G was designed with flexibility and portability in mind. The interface can easily be themed with CSS, and the Lightbox-style popups can be replaced or removed without loss of functionality.

All of the markup is XHTML 1.0 Strict, and the CSS is valid level 2, 2.1 and 3. This way, even in a text based browser with no JavaScript or CSS, the default Simple G pages are fully functional.

It is released under an MIT style licence, and was developed by the people at Simple Station Inc.
